# Barista Images Setup Guide

To complete the barista section, you need to add your barista photos to the `public` folder.

## Steps:

1. Save the following images to the `public` folder with these exact names:
   - `barista-work.jpg` - The image of you and colleagues at the mall (Image #1/4)
   - `latte-art.jpg` - The close-up photo of your latte art (Image #2)
   - `barista-portrait.jpg` - Your photo behind the Finders Cafe counter (Image #3)

2. The images should be placed directly in the `public` folder:
   ```
   cv-nathannail-wielianto/
   └── public/
       ├── barista-work.jpg
       ├── latte-art.jpg
       └── barista-portrait.jpg
   ```

3. Once you add these images, the gallery in your "Other Experiences" section will automatically display them!

## Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG, JPEG, or PNG
- Recommended size: 1200x800px or similar aspect ratio
- Try to keep file size under 500KB for optimal website performance

That's it! The images will show up in an interactive gallery with thumbnail navigation.
